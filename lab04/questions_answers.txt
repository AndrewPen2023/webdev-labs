1. What is the value of SQLAlchemy?
SQLAlchemy's value comes from its ability to abstract database access various relational databases with SQL. It makes it easier for the developer to write simpler and non-redundant code.

2. What is a model?
A model is a representation of a database schema relationship as a class in Python such that standard manipulation of an instance of the class in python appropriately manipulates a row in that database's corresponding table.

3. What is a view?
A view is a representation of possible user interactions with a database table as a class in Python, and individual instances of the class represent individual user access and their 'view' of that table.
